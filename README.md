3) Extraversion 
4) Agreeableness
5) Neuroticism.

as a scale. 

We setup a ideal scale value from 1 to 5 across all 5 traits and analyse tweets of a particular individual and compare with the ideal sclale on a kiviat chart. This project has a front end web page, a database and backend processing using weighted average classification.
